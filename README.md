# Job Listings Data Analysis Project with PySpark and Spark SQL

This project focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and analyzing job listings data scraped from multiple job boards (like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.). The goal is to gain insights into the current job market trends and provide valuable information to job seekers and employers.

## Project Steps:

1. **Schema Design:** Define the structure and data types for the job listings data, including job details, company information, requirements, and salaries.
2. **Data Loading:** Load the raw job listings data from multiple sources into a Spark DataFrame.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data to address inconsistencies, missing values, and standardize various fields. This includes handling categorical data, dates, numerical data, and text-based information.
4. **Data Transformation:** Transform the cleaned data into a structured format suitable for analysis, including standardizing salaries, extracting skills, and creating new features.
5. **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis using Spark SQL and PySpark to extract insights and trends from the data. This includes identifying in-demand skills, top job titles, and salary ranges by city.
6. **Reporting and Insights:** Summarize the project's findings and insights in a report format, highlighting key trends and observations.

## Tools and Technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Processing Framework:** Apache Spark
* **Data Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **SQL:** Spark SQL for data querying and analysis

## Data Sources:

* LinkedIn
* Indeed
* Glassdoor
* (Other job boards)

## Project Outcomes:

* Cleaned and standardized job listings dataset.
* Insights into in-demand skills, top job titles, and salary trends.
* Visualizations and reports summarizing the findings.

## Future Enhancements:

* Incorporate machine learning models to predict job salaries or recommend relevant jobs.
* Develop a user interface for data exploration and visualization.
* Expand data sources to include more job boards and geographic regions.
